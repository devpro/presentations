## Intro - Infrastructure automation dilemma

<div class="columns">
<div>

2020's need

* Dynamic environments
* Self-service portal
* 1 env = n components
* Single source of truth
* Easy to maintain by many
* Regular security patches
* 99.9x% availability

</div>
<div>

2010's approach

* CI/CD pipelines (push)
* Dev flow != Prod updates
* IaC complicated tooling
* No IaC orchestration standard
* Dev quality != Infra expertise

</div>

## GitOps - What? (GitLab)

> GitOps is an **operational framework** that takes DevOps best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to **infrastructure automation**.

üåê [gitlab.com/gitops](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/)

---

## GitOps - What? (Atlassian)

> At its core, GitOps is **code-based infrastructure and operational procedures** that rely on Git as a source control system.\
> It‚Äôs an evolution of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and a DevOps best practice that leverages **Git as the single source of truth**, and control mechanism for creating, updating, and deleting system architecture.

## GitOps - Why?

Action             | Reason
-------------------|---------------------------------------
**SIMPLIFY**       | Small YAML declarative files
**OPEN**           | Much larger collaboration
**RESPONSIBILIZE** | The right profile for the right action
**SCALE**          | Same effort for 10 or 10 000 env
**SECURE**         | Processes fully automated & versioned
**MONITOR**        | Cloud Native Observability stack

## OpenGitOps

> OpenGitOps is a set of open-source standards, best practices, and community-focused education to help organizations adopt a structured, standardized approach to implementing GitOps.

## GitOps Principles

1. **Declarative**

2. **Versioned and Immutable**

3. **Pulled Automatically**

4. **Continuously Reconciled**

## GitOps & Kubernetes - What? ([ClickIT](https://www.clickittech.com/devops/what-is-gitops/))

![center](./img/GitOps-blog-diagram-57-1024x563.jpg)

---

## GitOps & Kubernetes - How? (1/4)

Kubernetes definition format:

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
* [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)
* Raw manifests

---

## GitOps & Kubernetes - How? (2/4)

Environment strategy:

* one per folder
* one per git branch
* one per git repository

---

## GitOps & Kubernetes - How? (3/4)

:warning: No secret values in git!

Secret management tool for Kubernetes:

* [Bitnami Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
* [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/)
* [Vault Secrets Operator](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso)
* [Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/)

---

## GitOps & Kubernetes - How? (4/4)

GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes:

* [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)
* [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/)
* [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/)

---

## Argo CD

---

## Fleet

> Fleet is a container management and deployment engine designed to offer users more control on the local cluster and constant monitoring through GitOps

üåê [fleet.rancher.io](https://fleet.rancher.io/) ([rancher/fleet](https://github.com/rancher/fleet))

## GitOps - Getting started

* Enforce **good practices** in source code management with git
* Split integration/delivery/deployment tasks in pipelines
* Get **comfortable** with Helm charts
* **Evaluate** a set of tools and practices (ADRs)
* Start **small** in a non-production environment
* Add one component at a time
* Share regularly, get **feedbacks** and improve (Agile :D)
* Get people **on board** (DevOps \o/)

---

## GitOps - Advices for your journey

* **NEVER** store a secret value in git
  * Git never forgets (it it happens, generate a new one)
* Encourage Build & Run **COLLABORATION**
  * Dev & Ops can help each other (Dockerfile, Helm charts)
* Follow a **STANDARD**: Git Flow, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow
  * Many issues come from a wrong usage of git branches
* Host and manage your **OWN** application catalog
  * Validate & share the applications that can be used
